# Student Performance ML Project

This project analyzes student performance data using machine learning models and visualizations in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Correlation heatmap visualization
- Multiple data visualizations (class, semester, gender, nationality, grade, section, topic, stage, absence days)
- Classification using:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Perceptron
  - Logistic Regression
  - Neural Network (MLP Classifier)
- Model accuracy reporting
- Interactive prediction for user-specified input

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- numpy

## Usage
1. Place `AI-Data.csv` in the project directory.
2. Open `Student Performance.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially.
4. Follow the prompts for interactive visualizations and predictions.

## File Structure
- `Student Performance.ipynb`: Main notebook with code, visualizations, and ML models.
- `AI-Data.csv`: Dataset file .

## Notes
- The notebook uses interactive input for visualization and prediction.
- All warnings are suppressed for cleaner output.
